## 📌 Description  
This project implements a complete **smart greenhouse signal-processing pipeline** in MATLAB. It simulates multi-sensor environmental data, applies LTI (linear time-invariant) systems, performs Fourier analysis, custom filtering, anomaly detection, and a Laplace-style control demonstration.

It is designed according to the **Smart Environments (2025–2030)** course requirements.  
The greenhouse simulation includes signals for:
- Temperature  
- Humidity  
- Soil Moisture  
- CO₂ Concentration  
- Light Intensity  

All signals undergo realistic modeling, LTI filtering, FFT analysis, denoising, and visualization.
